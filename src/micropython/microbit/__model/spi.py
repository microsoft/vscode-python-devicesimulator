        This function is not implemented in the simulator.

        Initialize SPI communication with the specified parameters on the
        specified ``pins``. Note that for correct communication, the parameters
        have to be the same on both communicating devices.

        The ``baudrate`` defines the speed of communication.

        The ``bits`` defines the size of bytes being transmitted. Currently only
        ``bits=8`` is supported. However, this may change in the future.

        The ``mode`` determines the combination of clock polarity and phase
        according to the following convention, with polarity as the high order bit
        and phase as the low order bit:

        Polarity (aka CPOL) 0 means that the clock is at logic value 0 when idle
        and goes high (logic value 1) when active; polarity 1 means the clock is
        at logic value 1 when idle and goes low (logic value 0) when active. Phase
        (aka CPHA) 0 means that data is sampled on the leading edge of the clock,
        and 1 means on the trailing edge.

        The ``sclk``, ``mosi`` and ``miso`` arguments specify the pins to use for
        each type of signal.
