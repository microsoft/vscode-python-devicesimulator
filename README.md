Make without limit! Device Simulator Express, a Microsoft Garage project, allows you to code microcontrollers without the hardware on hand! You can program your Adafruit Circuit Playground Express (CPX) or your BBC micro:bit! Test and debug your code on the device simulator and see the same
result when you plug in your actual microcontroller. Curious about the output of the device, the serial
monitor allows you to observe the device output.

## Third Party Notice

A `ThirdPartyNotices.txt` file is provided in the extension's source code listing the appropriate third-party notices.

## Troubleshooting Tips

-   The first time you install the extension, you'll need to execute the `run` command at least once in order to access auto-completion.
-   While running a code file, if you get an error saying it can't find the file, make sure you've clicked on a valid Python code file before running it.
-   To open the output panel again after closing it go to VS Code menu: `View -> Output`.
-   If you try to deploy to the CPX while it's plugged in but you still get an error saying it cannot find the board, make sure your device is formatted correctly and that its name matches `CIRCUITPY`.
-   If you can't get the Simulator communication working while debugging, try to open your `Settings` and check the port used under `"Device Simulator Express: Debugger Server Port"`. You can either change it (usually ports above 5000 should work) or try to free it, then start debugging again.
-   When you are using the serial monitor, if you get some unusual error messages, unplug the device and reload the VS Code windows.
-   If you're using Ubuntu and having some problems with setting up the environment, try reviewing [this article's](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-ubuntu-16-04)  "Step 1" section on how to set up Python 3 on Ubuntu 16.04. Then, ensure that you've run `sudo apt-get install -y python3-venv` to allow for virtual environment creation.

## Notes

1. Make sure that when you type _python_ in a terminal, the command is recognized and you have the correct version. The easiest way to do it is to select the "Add to PATH" option directly when you install Python. Otherwise you can search how to insert it manually.
2. You can choose to see the prompt or not by changing the extension configurations.
